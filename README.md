# About me - 
Hiya, I'm Pakkane, but you can either call me just Ne or Pakka (as it states in my bio)
I usually sit by the main pathway in ponytown or the UNDERTALE fandom area! So if you need to find me I'll be in either of those spots. If you see don't be shy to sit with me or talk! I love meeting new people ^_^ Though I might be afk, but you can just pop me a whisper and I'll most likely respond!
I am in quite a few fandoms, most I am no longer active in though. The fandoms consits of; Undertale, Sk8 the infinity, The promised neverland, Sonic the headghog, Haikyuu!! Five Nights at Freddy's, Day Shift at Freddy's, Trolls, Bungo Stray Dogs, Neon Genesis Evangelion and probably more that I can't think of right now xb.
I have little to no hobbies, but the few I do have I'll put here > Drawing (traditonal, sometimes digitial although I am not very good at it) And reading.

I hope this helps you get to know me a bit better x) But feel free to talk with me! I do love  agood chat.
